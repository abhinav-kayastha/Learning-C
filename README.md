# Learning-C

Here is the syllabus I use to learn C:

   1. Basics of C Programming
        Introduction to C programming language
        Variables, data types, and constants
        Operators and expressions
        Control structures: if-else, else-if

   2. Input and Output (I/O) in C
        Basic Input and Output (I/O) concepts
        Reading input from the user (scanf function)
        Displaying output to the user (printf function)
        Handling formatted input and output (format specifiers)
        Converting between types (type casting, implicit and explicit conversion)

   3. Loops
        Introduction to loops: for, while, do-while
        Loop control statements: break and continue
        Nested loops

   4. Functions and Modular Programming
        Defining and calling functions
        Parameters and return values
        Function prototypes and header files
        Modular programming concepts

   5. Arrays and Strings
        Declaring and using arrays
        Multi-dimensional arrays
        Manipulating strings and string handling functions
        Working with character arrays

   6. Pointers and Memory Management
        Understanding pointers and their uses
        Pointer arithmetic
        Dynamic memory allocation: malloc, calloc, realloc, and free
        Pointer to functions

   7. File Input/Output
        Reading from and writing to files
        File operations: opening, closing, and manipulating files
        Sequential and random file access
        Error handling and file error codes

   8. Preprocessor Directives
        Overview of preprocessor directives
        Macros and their uses
        Conditional compilation using #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, etc.
        File inclusion and header guards

   9. Advanced Topics
        Bit manipulation and bitwise operators
        Enumerations and typedef
        Recursion and recursive functions
        Introduction to data structures (linked lists, queues, and stacks)

   10. Embedded C Programming
        Introduction to embedded systems
        Microcontrollers and their architecture
        Interfacing with peripherals (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, etc.)
        Interrupt handling and timers
