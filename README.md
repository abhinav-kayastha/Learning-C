# Learning-C

Here is the syllabus I use to learn C:

   1. Basics of C Programming:
        Introduction to C programming language
        Variables, data types, and constants
        Operators and expressions
        Control structures: if-else, else-if

   2. Input and Output (I/O) in C:
        Basic Input and Output (I/O) concepts
        Reading input from the user (scanf function)
        Displaying output to the user (printf function)
        Handling formatted input and output (format specifiers)
        Converting between types (type casting, implicit and explicit conversion)

   3. Loops:
        Introduction to loops: for, while, do-while
        Loop control statements: break and continue
        Nested loops
